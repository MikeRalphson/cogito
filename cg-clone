# Clone a remote GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# This clones a remote GIT repository and checks it out locally.
#
# Takes a parameter specifying the location of the source repository and an
# optional second parameter specifying the destination. If the second
# parameter is omitted, the basename of the source repository is used as the
# destination.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -l::	Symlink the object database when cloning locally
#	Symlink the object database when cloning locally, instead of
#	hardlinking all the objects. This is suitable for very fast
#	cloning of arbitrarily big repositories, but might be a trouble
#	in multi-user environments, and less solid arrangement in case
#	you do dangerous things with the database. Also, disappeared
#	or moved origin repository will obviously render this one unusable
#	as well. The choice is yours.
#	Note that you MUST NOT prune repository containing a symlink
#	or being symlinked to.
#
# -s::	Clone into the current directory
#	Clone in the current directory instead of creating a new one.
#	Specifying both -s and a destination directory makes no sense.
#
# NOTES
# -----
# If the clone has been interrupted for any reason, do not panic, calmly
# cd to the destination directory and run `cg-fetch`, which will in this case
# restart the initial clone. Chances are that you will not actually download
# any duplicate data. (At the time of writing this, the chances aren't for
# the native git protocol and ssh, but this may change in the future).

This is a clone-in-progress GIT working tree containing a GIT repository
in the .git subdirectory. If you see this file and noone is fetching or
cloning in this repository, the clone has been interrupted; you can restart
it by issuing this command (it's enough as-is):
