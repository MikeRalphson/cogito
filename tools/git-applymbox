## "dotest" is my stupid name for my patch-application script, which
## I never got around to renaming after I tested it. We're now on the
## second generation of scripts, still called "dotest".
##
## Update: Ryan Anderson finally shamed me into naming this "applymbox".
##
## You give it a mbox-format collection of emails, and it will try to
## apply them to the kernel using "applypatch"
##
## applymbox [ -c .dotest/msg-number ] [ -q ] mail_archive [Signoff_file]"
##
## The patch application may fail in the middle.  In which case:
## (1) look at .dotest/patch and fix it up to apply
## (2) re-run applymbox with -c .dotest/msg-number for the current one.
## Pay a special attention to the commit log message if you do this and
## use a Signoff_file, because applypatch wants to append the sign-off
## message to msg-clean every time it is run.
