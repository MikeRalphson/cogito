# Rename or move files in a GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes either two filenames and removes a file from the first one to
# the second one, or a list of filenames and a dirname and moves all
# the files to the directory. The changes will be executed in your working
# tree immediately, but recorded to the repository only at the time of the
# next commit.
#
# Note that so far, GIT/Cogito does not track file renames/moves per se.
# Therefore, doing `cg-mv` is currently the same as doing `cg-rm`, `cg-add`
# from the Cogito perspective, and no special information is recorded that
# the file moved around. When any rename tracking gets involved currently,
# it is purely heuristical method executed at the time of examination.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -f:: Force overwriting of existing files
#	Remove the target file if it already exists.
