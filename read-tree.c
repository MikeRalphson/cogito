		 * (1) For all other cases that read-tree internally
		 *     resolves a path, we always have such a path in
		 *     *both* stage2 and stage3 when we begin.
		 *     Traditionally, the behaviour has been even
		 *     stricter and we did not resolve a path without
		 *     initially being in all of stage1, 2, and 3.
		 *
		 * (2) When read-tree finishes, all resolved paths (i.e.
		 *     the paths that are in stage0) must have come from
		 *     either stage2 or stage3.  It is not possible to
		 *     have a stage0 path as a result of a merge if
		 *     neither stage2 nor stage3 had that path.
		 *
		 * (3) It is guaranteed that just after reading the
		 *     stages, each stage cannot have directory/file
		 *     conflicts on its own, because they are populated
		 *     by reading hierarchy of a tree.  Combined with
		 *     (1) and (2) above, this means that no matter what
		 *     combination of paths we take from stage2 and
		 *     stage3 as a result of a merge, they cannot cause
		 *     a directory/file conflict situation (otherwise
		 *     the "guilty" path would have already had such a
		 *     conflict in the original stage, either stage2
		 *     or stage3).  Although its stage2 is synthesized
		 *     by overlaying the current index on top of "our
		 *     head" tree, --emu23 case also has this guarantee,
		 *     by calling add_cache_entry() to create such stage2
		 *     entries.
		 *
		 * (4) Only #2ALT and #3ALT lack the guarantee (1).
		 *     They resolve paths that exist only in stage2
		 *     or stage3.  The stage2 tree may have a file DF
		 *     while stage3 tree may have a file DF/DF.  If
		 *     #2ALT and #3ALT rules happen to apply to both
		 *     of them, we would end up having DF (coming from
		 *     stage2) and DF/DF (from stage3) in the result.
		 *     When we attempt to resolve a path that exists
		 *     only in stage2, we need to make sure there is
		 *     no path that would conflict with it in stage3
		 *     and vice versa.
