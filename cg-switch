# Switch the working tree to another (possibly new) line of development
# Copyright (c) Yann Dirson, 2005
#
# Takes the LoD to switch to as mandatory argument, and a ref to the base commit
# of a LoD to be created as optional second argument.
# `cg-switch` allows to change the HEAD to another line of development (LoD),
# and to create a new LoD at a given point.
#
#      $ cg-switch v1.x v1.0    # creates a LoD for 1.x release at the v1.0 commit
#      $ cg-switch master       # back to trunk for more developement next major release
#
# This tool is still much a work in progress.  Things to do include:
# - mode to create the LoD only without really switching
# - deal with non-committed modifications before switch
# - allow switching "master" to another LoD (-i for "in-place switch" ?)
