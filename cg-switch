# Switch your current local branch.
# Copyright (c) Yann Dirson, Petr Baudis  2005
#
# `cg-switch` can switch your current local branch (and working copy)
# to an existing branch, or create a new branch based on a given commit.
#
# Terminology note: This command concerns local branches (also called
# "heads"), not remote branches (those managed by `cg-branch-add`).
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -f:: Enable overwriting of existing branches
#	Force the branch's head pointer update even if the branch
#	already exists. WARNING: The pointer to the original contents
#	of the branch will be lost! The contents itself will not be
#	deleted, `git-fsck-objects --unreachable` might help you to
#	find it.
#
# -n:: No switch; only create and update the branch
#	Do not switch your current branch to the given branch. This
#	will make cg-switch to only create or update the branch, but
#	leave your working copy alone.
#
# -r COMMIT_ID:: Branch off the given COMMIT_ID
#	Point the branch at the given commit. Defaults to the current
#	commit when creating a new branch; when switching to an existing
#	branch, the branch pointer is not modified if no '-r' is passed.
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE
# -------------
# To create a "v1.x" branch based on the commit "v1.0" and switch the
# working copy to it, making it your current branch, do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch -r v1.0 v1.x
#
# If you want to create the branch but don't switch your working copy
# to it (so that your current branch stays the same as before), do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch -n -r v1.0 v1.x
#
# If you want to go back to the 'master' branch, just do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch master
#
# To change the "v1.x" branch to refer to the latest commit on the
# "testing" branch, do (WARNING: you will lose the pointer to the
# original contents of the "v1.x" branch, be careful!):
#
# 	$ cg-switch -f -r testing v1.x
