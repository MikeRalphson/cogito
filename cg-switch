# Switch the working tree to another (possibly new) branch
# Copyright (c) Yann Dirson, 2005
#
# `cg-switch` allows to change the HEAD to another branch, and to
# create a new branch at a given point.
#
#   $ cg-switch v1.x v1.0              # creates a "1.x" branch at the v1.0 tag
#   $ cg-switch master                 # back to trunk
#   $ cg-switch -f master that-branch  # change "master" to refer to that-branch instead
#
# This tool is still much a work in progress.  Things to do include:
# - mode to create the branch only without really switching
# - deal with non-committed modifications before switch ?
# - allow switching "master" to another branch (-i for "in-place switch" ?)
# - safeguards to avoid problem when playing with remote branches ?
