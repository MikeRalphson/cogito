# Switch your current local branch.
# Copyright (c) Yann Dirson, Petr Baudis  2005
#
# `cg-switch` can switch your current local branch (and working copy)
# to an existing branch, or create a new branch based on a given commit.
#
# Terminology note: This command concerns local branches (also called
# "heads"), not remote branches (those managed by `cg-branch-add`).
#
# Note that `cg-switch` is meant for permanent switching of your current
# local branch (permanent in the sense that you are going to work on it;
# you can obviously `cg-switch` again later). If you want to just causually
# explore the current state of a particular branch of commit, use `cg-seek`.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -f:: Enable overwriting of existing branches
#	Force the branch's head pointer to be updated to whatever you
#	passed as the '-r' argument even if the branch already exists.
#	WARNING: The pointer to the original contents of the branch will
#	be lost! The contents itself will not be deleted right away,
#	`git-fsck-objects --unreachable` might help you to find it.
#	Besides, this can get very troublesome if you are pushing the
#	branch out - please refer to the documentation of a close
#	relative, `cg-admin-uncommit`.
#
# -l:: Preserve local changes in the branch
#	If your working tree has uncommitted local changes, the default
#	behaviour is that the changes will be reapplied to the new
#	branch after switching. With this option, however, the local
#	changes will be "kept" with your previous branch, you will
#	get a pristine tree of the new branch and when you switch back
#	to the original branch you will also get back the local changes.
#	(You do not need to pass any special switches when switching
#	back, '-l' has effect only on the branch you are switching _away_
#	from.)
#
# -n:: No switch; only create and update the branch
#	Do not switch your current branch to the given branch. This
#	will make cg-switch to only create or update the branch, but
#	leave your working copy alone.
#
# -r COMMIT_ID:: Branch off the given COMMIT_ID, create branch if non-existing
#	Point the branch at the given commit. Required when creating
#	a new branch (use "HEAD" if you want to just base the new
#	head on the current commit). When switching to an existing
#	branch, the branch pointer is modified if '-r' is passed
#	and confirmed by '-f'.
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE
# -------------
# To create a "v1.x" branch based on the commit "v1.0" and switch the
# working copy to it, making it your current branch, do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch -r v1.0 v1.x
#
# If you want to create the branch (let's say based on the current
# commit) but don't switch your working copy to it (so that your
# current branch stays the same as before), do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch -n -r HEAD v1.x
#
# If you want to go back to the 'master' branch, just do:
#
# 	$ cg-switch master
#
# To change the "v1.x" branch to refer to the latest commit on the
# "testing" branch, do (WARNING: you will lose the pointer to the
# original contents of the "v1.x" branch, be careful!):
#
# 	$ cg-switch -f -r testing v1.x
