# Remove files from a GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
# for removal from the GIT repository at the next commit.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -f:: Force removal of the physical files
#	Also delete the files from the tree physically.
#
# -n:: Keep the physical files
#	Do not delete the files from the tree physically, if they are
#	still there. So it effectively just makes Cogito to stop caring
#	about the file. This is the default.

USAGE="cg-rm [-f] [-n] FILE..."
