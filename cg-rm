# Remove files from the repository
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
# for removal from the GIT repository at the next commit. Those files
# are denoted by 'D' in the `cg-status` list. You can remove `cg-add`ed
# files to undo the addition; you can undo removals in an analogous way
# using `cg-add` and restore files deleted from the working copy using
# `cg-restore`.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -a:: Remove all files which are gone from the working copy
#	Record removal of all files which have been deleted from
#	the working copy.
#
# -f:: Force removal of the physical files
#	Also delete the files from the tree physically.
#
# -n:: Keep the physical files
#	Do not delete the files from the tree physically, if they are
#	still there. So it effectively just makes Cogito to stop caring
#	about the file. This is the default.
#
# -r:: Remove files recursively
#	If you pass cg-rm this flag and any directory names, it will try
#	to remove files in those directories recursively.

# Testsuite: Partial (used in many tests but a dedicated testsuite is missing)
