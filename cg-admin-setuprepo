# Setup a public GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Setup a public GIT repository, that is, one that has no attached working
# copy and you typically only push into it and pull from it. You need to run
# this command before you will be able to push into the repository for the
# first time.
#
# Use `cg-init` if you want to create a new GIT project instead.
#
# The command will create the repository to reside in DIRECTORY. By default,
# it will be world-readable, but writable only by you. If you want to make
# it possible for multiple users to push, create a group for them and use the
# '-g' parameter, which will make `cg-admin-setuprepo` set up the permissions
# properly.
#
# The repository will also be set up so that `git-update-server-info` will
# be automagically re-ran after each push, making it suitable for HTTP access.
#
# Note that you might need to do other additional steps, like touching the
# 'git-daemon-export-ok' file if you want to make the repository accessible
# over git-daemon.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -g GROUP::
#	Name of the UNIX group covering the users authorized to push into
#	the repository. If unspecified, only you (who ran this command) will
#	have write (push) access.
#
# NOTES
# -----
# It may happen that you are using version of GIT missing the default
# post-update hook, or that the relevant template hooks are not available
# on your system or with your GIT installation. In that case, in order to
# have your repository properly accessible with HTTP, you need to add this
# to .git/hooks/post-update (and then to make it eXecutable):
#
#	#!/bin/sh
#	exec git-update-server-info
