This version of Cogito should work on OS X and other BSD variants.

To install on OS X:

1) Install darwinports (http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/) 2) type
"make Portfile" 3) type "sudo port install"

You may have to deal with md5 mismatches.  Either adjust the md5sum in
your new Portfile or place the new tarball in
/opt/local/var/db/dports/distfiles/cogito.

Caveats:

cg-pull on a local repository requires cp -u, a non-portable gnu
extension.  This means that cg-pull, cg-clone and cg-update from a
local repository are broken.

Workaround #1: Use rsync for local clones.  I.e.  "cg-clone
rsync://localhost/dir" instead of "cg-clone dir".  This loses the disk
space savings of normally gained by cg-clone.

Workaround #2: Use gnu cp.  "cd /opt/local/bin; sudo ln -s gcp cp".

Recommendations:

The gnu versions of "stat" and "date" are preferred over their BSD
variants.

"patch", "diff", "merge", "curl" and "rysnc" are required.  OS X.4
includes recent versions of these tools.  If you are not running X.4,
you may wish to check this.
