#
# Add files to the GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
# for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit.
#
# The command will fail if one of the given files does not exist.
#
# Note that directories never have to be added to the repository, and are
# not tracked on their own. That means, you cannot currently add an empty
# directory to 'Cogito'. The reason for this is that 'Cogito' manages
# content and empty directories have no content. Directories are added
# automatically when adding files inside them, or you can add all files in
# a directory using cg-add -r.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -N::
#	Only update the cache: do not copy the data into the object database.
#	This is for special purposes when you might not actually _have_ any
#	object database. This option is normally not interesting.
# -r::
#	If you pass cg-add this flag and any directory names, it will try
#	to add files in those directories recursively (with regard to your
#	ignore rules - see cg-status documentation for more detailed
#	description of those). See also above for more notes about cg-add
#	vs. directories.
