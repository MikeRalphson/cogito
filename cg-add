# Add files to the GIT repository.

#
# Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
# for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit.
#
# The command will fail if one of the given files does not exist.
#
# Note that directories never have to be added to the repository and any
# attempt in doing so will cause the command to fail. The reason for this
# is that 'Cogito' manages content and empty directories have no content.
# Instead, directories are added automatically when adding files inside
# them.
