#
# Lists IDs of all the objects of a given type found in the dircache.
# Takes the object type as the first parameter, defaults to all objects.
#
# The possible object types are:
#
# blob::
#	This object is a pure storage object containing some user data.
#
# commit::
#	This object ties directory hierarchies together into a DAG
#	of revisions.
#
# tree::
#	This object is an object that ties one or more `blob` objects
#	into a directory structure.
#
# tag::
#	This object ties a symbolic release tag to an object in the
#	database.
#
# See the git README for more information about the object types.
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE
# -------------
# Oh, I was messing with my HEADs and lost few commits, where on the earth
# could they be...?
#
#	for i in `cg-admin-lsobj commit | cut -f 1`; do
#		echo -e "\n==================\nme $i"; cat-file commit $i;
#	done
