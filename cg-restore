# Restore removed/changed files in the working tree.

#
# Restore given files to their original state. Without any parameters,
# it recovers any files removed locally whose removal was not recorded
# by `cg-rm`.
#
# If passed a set of file names, it restores those files to their
# state as of the last commit (including bringing files removed with
# `cg-rm` back to life; FIXME: does not do that part yet).
#
# This command is complementary to the `cg-cancel` command, which
# forcefully abandons all the changes in the working tree and
# restores everything to a proper state (including unseeking,
# cancelling merge in progress and rebuilding indexes).
