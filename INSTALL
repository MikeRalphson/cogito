		Cogito installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", and that
will install the Cogito scripts in your own ~/bin/ directory.
If you want to do a global install, you can do

	make prefix=/usr install

(or prefix=/usr/local, of course).  Some day somebody may send me a RPM
spec file or something, and you can do "make rpm" or whatever.

Issues of note:

 - Cogito normally installs a helper script wrapper called "cg", which
   might conflict with another similarly named program.

   Tough.  The wrapper is however completely optional and everything
   will work fine if you delete it and just directly use the individual
   tools.

 - Cogito needs a pre-existing Git installation. It is recommended to
   use at least version 0.99.7 or newer (provided that Git stays
   backwards compatible). Watch this spot if you update Cogito to see
   the possible new minimal version requirement. You can get Git at
