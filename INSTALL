		Cogito installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", and that
will install the Cogito scripts in your own ~/bin/ directory.
If you want to do a global install, you can do

	make prefix=/usr install

(or prefix=/usr/local, of course).  Some day somebody may send me a RPM
spec file or something, and you can do "make rpm" or whatever.

You can place local settings in config.mak and the Makefile will include
them.  Note that config.mak is not distributed; the name is reserved for
local settings.


Issues of note:

 - Cogito normally installs a helper script wrapper called "cg", which
   might conflict with another similarly named program.

   Tough.  The wrapper is however completely optional and everything
   will work fine if you delete it and just directly use the individual
   tools.

 - Cogito needs a pre-existing Git installation. It is recommended to
   use at least version 1.1.0 or newer (provided that Git stays
   backwards compatible). Watch this spot if you update Cogito to see
   the possible new minimal version requirement. You can get Git at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git

 - By default, separate documentation (manpages, text, HTML) is not built
   since it requires asciidoc and xmlto, and those tools are not so common.
   You can build it by "make doc" and install it later by "make install-doc"
   in the project root, or you can build directly in the "Documentation/"
   subdirectory, where you can also choose to build only documentation in
   particular format. See Documentation/Makefile for further details.

   Note that the documentation is always available by

	cg-help cmdname

   or "cg-cmdname --help" and it is _exactly_ the same content as what you
   will get by building separate documentation - the only extra you would
   get is a page about 'cogito' itself, containing some general blather.
