git-peek-remote(1)
==================
v0.1, July 2005

NAME
----
git-peek-remote - Lists the references on a remote repository.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-peek-remote' [--exec=<git-upload-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Lists the references the remote repository has, and optionally
stores them in the local repository under the same name.

OPTIONS
-------
--exec=<git-upload-pack>::
	Use this to specify the path to 'git-upload-pack' on the
	remote side, if is not found on your $PATH.
	Installations of sshd ignores the user's environment
	setup scripts for login shells (e.g. .bash_profile) and
	your privately installed GIT may not be found on the system
	default $PATH.  Another workaround suggested is to set
	up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people
	who do not want to pay the overhead for non-interactive
	shells by having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of
	the things up in .bash_profile).

<host>::
	A remote host that houses the repository.  When this
	part is specified, 'git-upload-pack' is invoked via
	ssh.

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.
