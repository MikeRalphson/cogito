This document describes which hooks cogito cares about and
when it executes them.

Introduction
------------
This file is currently not listing all hooks. I am currently
finding them by grep'ing them out of cogito-scripts:
`grep -i hooks *`. As soon as the listing is complete, this intro
will vanish.

Hooks
-----
All hooks can be found below ".git/hooks". Always remember: A hook
will only be called it it has the x-bit set (chmod 0755 .git/hook/'name').

update
~~~~~~
This hook will be called by `cg-push` on the *remote* side. You could
use it for mailing out information about the latest update.
