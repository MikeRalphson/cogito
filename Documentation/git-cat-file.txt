v0.1, May 2005

NAME
----
git-cat-file - Provide content or type information for repository objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-cat-file' (-t | <type>) <object>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Provides content or type of objects in the repository. The type
is required if '-t' is not being used to find the object type.

OPTIONS
-------
<object>::
	The sha1 identifier of the object.

-t::
	Instead of the content, show the object type identified by
	<object>.

<type>::
	Typically this matches the real type of <object> but asking
	for a type that can trivially dereferenced from the given
	<object> is also permitted.  An example is to ask for a
	"tree" with <object> being a commit object that contains it,
	or to ask for a "blob" with <object> being a tag object that
	points at it.

OUTPUT
------
If '-t' is specified, one of the <type>.

Otherwise the raw (though uncompressed) contents of the <object> will
be returned.
