NAME
----
cogito - version control system

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-COMMAND <arg>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'Cogito' is a version control system layered on top of the git tree history
storage system. Amongst some of the noteworthy features, 'Cogito' has support
for branching, tagging and multiple backends for distributing repositories
(local files, rsync, HTTP, ssh).

'Cogito' is implemented as a series of 'bash(1)' scripts on top of $(link git)
(a content-tracking filesystem) with the goal of providing an interface for
working with the 'GIT' database in a manner similar to other SCM tools (like
'CVS', 'BitKeeper' or 'Monotone').

Commands Overview
-----------------

The 'Cogito' commands can be split into regular commands and advanced commands.
The regular commands are those used for normal interacting with the repository,
while the advanced commands can be used for administrating the repository and
should to some degree be regarded as low-level and in some cases dangerous.

Below an overview of the available commands are listed. For details on
individual commands, do e.g.

	cg-help cg-log

or

	cg-log --help

Helper commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few helper commands that are not meant to be used from the command
line. They provide a library of generic functions used by many of the real
'Cogito' commands. You can safely ignore them, unless you want to contribute to
'Cogito' development.

Command Identifiers
-------------------
BRANCH::
	Indicates a branch name added with the $(link cg-branch-add) name.

COMMAND::
	Indicates a 'Cogito' command. The \`cg-\` prefix is optional.

DESTINATION::

	be used interchangably as IDs:
	- empty string, 'this' or 'HEAD' (current HEAD)
	- branch name (as registered with $(link cg-branch-add))
	- tag name (as registered with $(link cg-tag))
	- shortcut object hash (shorted unambiguous hash lead)
	- commit object hash (as returned by 'commit-id')
	- tree object hash (as returned by 'tree-id')

	Indicates a free form tag name.

TYPE::
	Indicates a git object type i.e.: 'blob', 'commit', 'tree' or 'tag'.
