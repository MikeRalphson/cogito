This directory contains a script (`script.sh`) by Horst H. von Brand
<vonbrand@inf.utfsm.cl>, which is sort of a tutorial in form of a linear
shell script showing various stages in the project development and how
Cogito supports them.

Note that it may be a bit dated sometimes, since it is not updated regularly.
