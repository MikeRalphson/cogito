# from e-mail, merging multiple tags at once, verifying signed tags and
# repacking the repository.
#
# Not that there would be anything wrong per se with this; GIT and Cogito
# can interoperate fine (except few quite special situations; see the README
# for details) and you can mix the commands; Cogito might never provide
# wrappers for some of the GIT features which are nevertheless awesomely
# useful, like `git bisect`.


# This function is appended as "&& should_fail" to commands which should
# fail. Readers please pretend that it is not here at all - it is useful
# for executing this script to make sure we did not break it with any
# Cogito changes.

### Alice integrates the changes in the branches for the next release
