NAME

git-diff-files - Compares files in the working tree and the cache


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-diff-files' [-p] [-q] [-r] [-z] [-B] [-M] [-C] [-R] [-O<orderfile>] [-S<string>] [--pickaxe-all] [<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Compares the files in the working tree and the cache.  When paths
are specified, compares only those named paths.  Otherwise all
entries in the cache are compared.  The output format is the
same as "git-diff-cache" and "git-diff-tree".

OPTIONS
-------
-p::
	generate patch (see section on generating patches).

-q::
	Remain silent even on nonexisting files

-R::
	Output diff in reverse.

-B::
	Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create.

-M::
	Detect renames.

-C::
	Detect copies as well as renames.

-S<string>::
	Look for differences that contains the change in <string>.

--pickaxe-all::
	When -S finds a change, show all the changes in that
	changeset, not just the files that contains the change
	in <string>.

-O<orderfile>::
	Output the patch in the order specified in the
	<orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line.

-r::
	This flag does not mean anything.  It is there only to match
	git-diff-tree.  Unlike git-diff-tree, git-diff-files always looks
	at all the subdirectories.


Output format
-------------
include::diff-format.txt[]
