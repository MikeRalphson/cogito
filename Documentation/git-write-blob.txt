NAME
----
git-write-blob - Creates a blob from a file


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-write-blob' <any-file-on-the-filesystem>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Writes the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the work
tree) as a blob into the object database, and reports its object ID to its
standard output.  This is used by "git-merge-one-file-script" to update the
cache without modifying files in the work tree.
