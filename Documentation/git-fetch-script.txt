git-fetch-script(1)
===================
v0.1, July 2005

NAME
----
git-fetch-script - Download objects and a head from another repository.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-fetch-script' <repository> [ <head> | tag <tag> ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Fetches a named head or a tag from another repository, along
with the objects necessary to complete that head or tag.  The
head to pull defaults to HEAD if unspecified.  The head or tag
fetched from the remote repository is stored in
$GIT_DIR/FETCH_HEAD.

When a <tag> is specified, the <tag> fetched from the remote is
also copied to the local $GIT_DIR/tags/<tag> file.  When no
<head> nor <tag> is specified, and <repository> was specified
with the short-hand notation (i.e. naming a file under the
$GIT_DIR/branches directory), the head fetched from the remote
repository is also copied to the local $GIT_DIR/heads/<repository>
file.
