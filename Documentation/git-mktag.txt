git-mktag(1)
============
v0.1, May 2005

NAME
----
git-mktag - Creates a tag object


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-mktag' < signature_file

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object
that can also be used to sign other objects.

The output is the new tag's <object> identifier.

Tag Format
----------
A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: three lines of

  object <sha1>
  type <typename>
  tag <tagname>

followed by some 'optional' free-form signature that git itself
doesn't care about, but that can be verified with gpg or similar.

The size of the full object is artificially limited to 8kB.  (Just
because I'm a lazy bastard, and if you can't fit a signature in that
size, you're doing something wrong)
