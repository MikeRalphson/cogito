# Add new branch to the GIT repository.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# After you add a branch, you can cg-pull it whenever you want
# and it will keep your objects database in sync with it. Its latest
# commit is accessible as .git/refs/heads/branchname (or - more conveniently
# - as $(commit-id branchname)). For example, to make a diff between
# Linus (after you added him) and your current tree, do
#
#	cg-pull linus
#	cg-diff linus
#
#
# The possible location specifiers are:
#
# (1) Local path - note that pulling will hardlink the objects, not copy them.
# (2) rsync - either rsync://host/path or host:/path (the latter can change)
# (3) HTTP - http://host/path
# (4) SSH - git+ssh://[user@]host/absolute/path
#
# The URL can have a fragment part, which identifies a branch inside of
# the repository. Therefore, if you have a repository
# rsync://kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/mj/linux.git and you are interested
# in its 'testing' branch, you can e.g.
#
#	cg-branch-add mj-testing \
#		rsync://kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/mj/linux.git#testing
#
# and refer to it as 'mj-testing' anytime later.
#
#
# Takes the branch' name and location as parameters.
