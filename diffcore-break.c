	 * There are two criteria used in this algorithm.  For the
	 * purposes of helping later rename/copy, we take both delete
	 * and insert into account and estimate the amount of "edit".
	 * If the edit is very large, we break this pair so that
	 * rename/copy can pick the pieces up to match with other
	 * files.
	 *
	 * On the other hand, we would want to ignore inserts for the
	 * pure "complete rewrite" detection.  As long as most of the
	 * existing contents were removed from the file, it is a
	 * complete rewrite, and if sizable chunk from the original
	 * still remains in the result, it is not a rewrite.  It does
	 * not matter how much or how little new material is added to
	 * the file.
	 *
	 * The score we leave for such a broken filepair uses the
	 * latter definition so that later clean-up stage can find the
	 * pieces that should not have been broken according to the
	 * latter definition after rename/copy runs, and merge the
	 * broken pair that have a score lower than given criteria
	 * back together.  The break operation itself happens
	 * according to the former definition.
	 *
	 * The minimum_edit parameter tells us when to break (the
	 * amount of "edit" required for us to consider breaking the
	 * pair).  We leave the amount of deletion in *merge_score_p
	 * when we return.
	 *
	 * The value we return is 1 if we want the pair to be broken,
	 * or 0 if we do not.
