Description: The git content addressable filesystem
 GIT comes in two layers. The bottom layer is merely an extremely fast
 and flexible filesystem-based database designed to store directory trees
 with regard to their history. The top layer is a SCM-like tool which
 enables human beings to work with the database in a manner to a degree
 similar to other SCM tools (like CVS, BitKeeper or Monotone).
