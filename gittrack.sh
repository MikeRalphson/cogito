# Makes your working tree track the given branch.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# This script will make your tree track the given branch (remote).
# Basically, everytime you pull from it, the changes on that branch
# from the last pull will be applied to your tree, and your tree's
# head pointer will be updated.
#
# You can track only one branch; not multiple branches simultanously,
# and they don't even stack. Your branch before checking (probably
# the local branch) can be referenced to by id "local" until you
# untrack (or try to track "local", which is equivalent).
#
# BTW, we do the tracking by applying a patch instead of read-tree &&
# checkout-cache since that will destroy all the local changes but
# also not wipe out any stale files. It is going to be much faster
# anyway.
#
# If you want to offer people a branch which is tracked by default,
# you do not want any local branch. Just delete .git/HEAD.local.
#
# Takes the branch name. No parameter (or "local") untracks the tree.
