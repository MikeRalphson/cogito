# Seek the working tree to a given commit.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes the target commit ID to seek to as an argument.
# Seeking will bring the working tree from its current 'HEAD' to a given
# commit. Note that it changes just the 'HEAD' of the working tree, not
# the branch it is corresponding to. It will return to the 'HEAD' of
# the appropriate branch if passed no arguments.
#
# Therefore, for a quick excurse to the past of the 'master' branch:
#
#	$ cg-seek git-pasky-0.1
#	$ cg-diff this master	# will do the correct thing
#	$ cg-seek		# will restore what we had before
#
# For intuitiveness, specifying the branch name (`cg-seek master`) will do
# the right thing too. If you want to migrate your working tree to another
# branch, use `cg-clone`.
