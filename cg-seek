# Seek the working tree to a given commit.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# This will bring the working tree from its current HEAD to a given
# commit. Note that it changes just the HEAD of the working tree, not
# the branch it is corresponding to. It will return to the HEAD of
# the appropriate branch if passed no arguments.
#
# Therefore, for a quick excurse to the past of the 'master' branch:
#
#	cg-seek git-pasky-0.1
#	cg-diff this master # will do the correct thing
#	cg-seek # will restore what we had before
#
# For intiutiveness, specifying the branch name (cg-seek master) will do
# the right thing too. If you want to migrate your working tree to another
# branch, use cg-fork.
#
# Takes the target commit ID.
