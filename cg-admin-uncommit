# Undo a commit or a series of commits.

#
# Takes a commit ID which is the earliest commit to be removed from
# the repository. If no parameter is passed, it uncommits the latest
# commit ('HEAD'). Read the CAVEATS section before using it for the
# first time.
#
# This command is a close relative of `cg-switch -f` (which does
# essentially the same thing, but is slightly more powerful at the
# expense of a more elaborate usage). Do not confuse either with the
# operation performed by `cg-seek`, which is meant only for temporary
# excursions to the project history.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -t:: Restore the working copy of the previous commit
#	This optional parameter makes `cg-admin-uncommit` to roll back
#	the tree as well to the previous commit. Without this option
#	(by default) 'Cogito' keeps the tree in its current state,
#	therefore generating tree with local changes against the target
#	commit, consisting of the changes in the rolled back commits.
#
# CAVEATS
# -------
# This command can be dangerous! It is safe to do as long as you do not
# push the commit out in the meantime, but you should 'NEVER' uncommit an
# already pushed out commit. Things will break for the fetchers since you
# just broke the fast-forward merging mechanism (the new commit is not
# descendant of the previous one), and the push command will refuse to
# push again after you uncommitted a pushed out commit, too. At the moment
# you pushed the commit out it's etched to the history, live with that.
