# This script reverts the working tree to a consistent state before
# any changes to it (including merges etc) were done.
#
# Basically, this is the opposite of cg-commit in some sense.
#
# Takes no arguments and the evil changes from the tree.
#
# This command is complementary to cg-restore, which only brings
# individual files in sync with their state at the time of the
# last commit.
