Why I want to remove bash from cogito scripts and what
the current status is. This document shall vanish from
this repository as soon as bash is removed from the headers ;-)


Reason
------
- bash is not available on any system.
- Mostly the scripts use standard shell expressions / commands.
- bash is slower than other shells
- standard posix conform shell is /bin/sh
- let the user choose, whether to use bash, ksh, dash, whatever for cogito

Main reason for me: I replaced the link from /bin/sh to /bin/bash some years
ago with /bin/(d)ash, because it is much faster and uses less memory.

I do not want to loose performance just because using bash.

And there are some systems I use which do not have bash installed.

But I WANT to use bash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No problem, simply link /bin/sh to /bin/bash.


Status
------
cg-Xlib is the biggest problem as far as I can see it. As soon as it
is includedable in non-bash shells the rest will be no big work.
