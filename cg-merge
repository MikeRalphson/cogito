# Merge a branch to the current tree.
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a parameter identifying the branch to be merged, defaulting
# to 'origin'.
#
# This command merges all changes currently in the given branch to your
# current branch. This can produce a merging commit on your branch sticking
# the two branch together (so-called 'tree merge'). However in case there
# are no changes in your branch that wouldn't be in the remote branch, no
# merge commit is done and commit pointer of your branch is just updated
# to the last commit on the remote branch (so-called 'fast-forward merge').
#
# In case of conflicts being generated by the merge, you have to examine
# the tree (cg-merge will tell you which files contain commits; the commits
# are denoted by rcsmerge-like markers <<<<, ====, and >>>>) and then do
# `cg-commit` yourself. `cg-commit` will know that you are committing a merge
# and will record it properly.
#
# Note that when you are merging remote branches, `cg-merge` will use them
# in the state they are currently at in your repository. If you want to
# fetch the latest changes from the remote repository, use `cg-fetch`. If you
# want to fetch the changes and then merge them to your branch, use the command
# `cg-update`.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -b BASE_COMMIT::
#	Parameter specifies the base commit for the merge. Otherwise, the
#	least common ancestor is automatically selected.
#
# -c::
#	Parameter specifies that you want to have tree merge never
#	autocomitted, but want to review and commit it manually. This will
#	basically make cg-merge always behave like there were conflicts
#	during the merge.
#
# FILES
# -----
# $GIT_DIR/hooks/merge-pre::
#	If the file exists and is executable it will be executed right
#	before the merge itself happens. The script is passed those
#	arguments:
#		BRANCHNAME BASE CURHEAD MERGEDHEAD MERGETYPE
#	MERGETYPE is either "forward" or "tree". The merge is
#	cancelled if the script returns non-zero exit code.
#
# $GIT_DIR/hooks/merge-post::
#	If the file exists and is executable it will be executed after
#	the merge is done. The script is passed those arguments:
#		BRANCHNAME BASE CURHEAD MERGEDHEAD MERGETYPE STATUS
#	MERGETYPE is either "forward" or "tree". For "forward", the
#	STATUS is always "ok", while for "tree" the STATUS can be
#	"localchanges", "conflicts", "nocommit", or "ok".
