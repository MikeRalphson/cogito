test_description='Three way merge with read-tree -m

This test tries three-way merge with read-tree -m

There is one ancestor (called O for Original) and two branches A
and B derived from it.  We want to do a 3-way merge between A and
B, using O as the common ancestor.

    merge A O B

Decisions are made by comparing contents of O, A and B pathname
by pathname.  The result is determined by the following guiding
principle:

 - If only A does something to it and B does not touch it, take
   whatever A does.

 - If only B does something to it and A does not touch it, take
   whatever B does.

 - If both A and B does something but in the same way, take
   whatever they do.

 - If A and B does something but different things, we need a
   3-way merge:

   - We cannot do anything about the following cases:

     * O does not have it.  A and B both must be adding to the
       same path independently.

     * A deletes it.  B must be modifying.

   - Otherwise, A and B are modifying.  Run 3-way merge.

First, the case matrix.

 - Vertical axis is for A'\''s actions.
 - Horizontal axis is for B'\''s actions.

In addition:

 SS: a special case of MM, where A and B makes the same modification.
 LL: a special case of AA, where A and B creates the same file.
 TT: a special case of MM, where A and B makes mergeable changes.
 DF: a special case, where A makes a directory and B makes a file.
